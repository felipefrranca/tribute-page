            <h3>Who Was Ada Lovelace?</h3>
            
            <p>
                English mathematician Ada Lovelace, the daughter of poet Lord Byron, has been called "the first computer programmer" for writing an algorithm for a computing machine in the mid-1800s. 
    
                Ada Lovelace is considered the first computer programmer. Even though she wrote about a computer, the Analytical Engine, that was never built, she realized that the computer could follow a series of simple instructions, a program, to perform a complex calculation. ... She has been called the first computer programmer.

            <p>
                Lovelace's contributions to the field of computer science were not discovered until the 1950s. Her notes were reintroduced to the world by B.V. Bowden, who republished them in Faster Than Thought: A Symposium on Digital Computing Machines in 1953. Since then, Ada has received many posthumous honors for her work. In 1980, the U.S. Department of Defense named a newly developed computer language "Ada," after Lovelace.
